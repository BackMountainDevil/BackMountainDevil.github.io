# 兴坪纪事2 阳朔的大理 与 Central Perk

饭后杂文，仅供参考。此文是兴坪纪事的第二篇。上一篇的[在这](https://backmountaindevil.github.io/#/wuyu/artical/xingping)。将近两个月的暑假，估计是人生中为数不多的长假了，才过去了一个月，再回头看发现时间过的好快，快到痘痘长了消、消了长，有点青春尚在、又伴随着长痘的厌恶，尽管尽量避免触碰到痘痘，尤其是快自愈的时候，但还是在洗脸的时候不小心搓掉了，痘印消失的时间就这样被拉长了。

在英语口语课上，谈到暑假的时候，拿兴坪的两个月作为回答，没想到学术英语也要写一篇假期，于是就继续写兴坪，遇到不会的词就得靠翻译了，字迹还是“龙飞凤舞”的狂草，尽管尽量整齐最后还是歪歪扭扭的，想着既然写都写了，不如就再翻回中文说一说吧

It is the first time that I decide to how to spend my vacation. For lots of reasons, I can not control the vacation time by myself. I need to be in the factory or in the hospital. I got a tutor part-time job at the begining of 2022. So I can pay for my vacation when I graduated from China Agricultural University.

I left China Agricultural University on 6.28 by high speed rail. I went to hometown to wait for my luggage. During the waiting time, I made an appointment to donate blood. Before that I have four donation records. But this time I want to try some different.  So I chose to donate one unit of platelets by apheresis this time instead of giving full blood of 400 millilitres. That choice made the giving time so long that I watched a  few eposides of SPY×FAMILY. In that room, there are workers, nurses and some students who just finished their Gaokao and will be a police or nurse in the future.

Although I want to decide the way of having the last long vacatino, I still have no idea where to go. I just look through the advertisements on the Internet. I would like to go to the city along seaside that I will be able to enjoy the sea via surfing and diving. To be honest, I can not surfing or diving yet. I want to try these things because a bilibili tuber called Uncle DaMo. He captures some beautiful and funny videos of surfing and diving in HaiNan province. Because of those videos, I start to look for the hotels at seaside. Some home accommodations only hire girls. One night, I was shopping at supermarket, a new hire posted in Douban. the position is quite close to me. It is a shop sells tea-thing and pottery service. My work is teaching the guest to make tea cup, bowl, flower vase and so on. That shop is close to railway station which means I can run away quickly if situation gets bad.

My vacation starts with pottery cup. The store is built with wood, which reminds me of my childhood live in the same wooden house. There are two big dogs in the store. we usually call boss Da Hai because there is sea in his name. His wife is pregnant. And there is a aunt who cooks lunch and dinner for us. We live on the second floor. At the begining, the two dogs are quite friendly to me during the day. But when the nights come, both will start to bark at me, which makes me feel uncomfortable. Few days later, these dogs are familiar with me. I can touch them and walk at night. I spent three days to learn how to make pottery clay into a terrible cup from boss. From that on, I practice how to make beautiful cup from time to time. I also watch how boss make delicate cup and try to learn the way. A week later, the thickness of the cup reduce from 8mm to 3mm. How to make a teapot is quite diffcult for me although I konw all the steps. Then I start to search a easy way to make a teapot form the Internet. I try the ways from web and get some funny vases and teapots, which will leak unexpectedly.

There are beautiful landscape, some nice neighbors and love stories. It is the first time to fell Yang Suo Karst by myself. I only watch thess wired mountains from web and train. Da Hai's friends open stores too. Such as bakery, home accommodation, restaurant, souvenir shop. And some friends are angel investors. Sometimes we will eat at his friend's. Different dishes, different people from different city in a same town. I get a feeling like warm and harmonious. And some of them keep cats and dogs. Stay with these hairy animals, that feels awesome. One night we sit around the windows near the street  in the ShanZhongSuiYue bakery. I feel like I am in the Central Perk at that moment. The people live in a slow pace of life. Most people wake up naturally in the morning and close store in the afternoon. If you want to look for night life, XingPing is not a proper town. Maybe Xijie is the one you look for night life.

当然有时候翻译过去就表达不出这个味道了，毕竟我也不是信达雅的翻译大家，只好再写点中文来补充说明在兴坪的日子。大概的感觉就像老友记、生活大爆炸。特别是傍晚的山中岁月，有一种“中央公园咖啡馆”的韵味，不过里面没有菲比驻唱

## 慢节奏

在阳朔高铁站下车后坐大巴十分钟左右即可抵达兴坪汽车站，也可以一路坐到阳朔。早上睡到自然醒，嗦一碗桂林米粉，溜一圈狗狗，便开始接待客人，通常假期大家都不想早期，因此早上客人较少，中午天晒也热，人也不多，下午慢慢的人人就多起来了，也要提防有些潜行在游客中的不良人。通常晚饭过后大多数店铺都收摊了，除了少数几家住在店里头的打烊的比较晚，不过还是要早点吃晚饭，晚了肚子饿保不齐真没地方买吃的。

## 人间百态

疫情几年，老板手里头的店铺由两位数缩减为个位数。属实超出了我的认知范围，银饰、辣椒、衣服丝巾店铺说不准都是同一家股东。

在这条街上遇到两次吃席，都在新街靠车站这一头，一位寿终正寝，另一位疾病缠身，敲锣打鼓，游客该游游，席照旧，毕竟后面的游客也不知道前一天这个奶茶店里边摆的是谁家的棺材。有时候晚上放炮还能把我叫醒。某一阵子去爬老寨山的时候，有一股臭味在一个地方许久未散，大海说是埋浅了。还有一位只有当地居民才知道的，我走时警方还在调查。

新街上装了监控、路灯也已经都修好了。6.28 的发大水把古街一楼都淹了，餐饮的冰箱、冰柜、空调基本都泡水了，当然也少不了车子泡水，由于芯片短缺修车的也缺芯片（气囊芯片）。这些念头小偷变少了，但也不是没有，虽然不是扒手，但是也在发展，发展的可以装的和不是小偷一样。有一堆人在银饰店试一试的，到最后清点发现少了一个，追到门扁发现戴在手上，说是忘了；还有的实在衣服饰品店，在街角被追到还说没有，然后“不小心”发现还戴在耳朵上，此时小偷还可能仗着人多压价。

除了外来扒手之外，还有街坊邻居，在餐饮店旁边，油烟味过重，可能是油烟机没开，也可能是管道不符合规范，最糟心的是餐饮后厨卫生带来的老鼠。

## 古香古色

古镇两条街道大部分还保持着上个世纪的砖木结构，但似乎当地政府没有想保持这种木质结构的倾向，今年暑期看到危房摇摇欲坠，没有人类活动的木房子也会因为缺乏修缮走向消亡。我也好奇木质结构有那么坚固吗？我记忆中老家的木质结构是单层结构，楼顶是南方多雨地区常见的两侧下坡式瓦片（名字自己瞎起的）。砖头是泥块糊成的，没住人之后漏雨渗水倒塌，最后几家人合计把那块地推倒了盖一个小祠堂（是真的小）。古镇这边的砖头多为青砖两层结构。我起初住二楼时还担心就那几根木头靠谱吗，后面就跟南方人在北方澡堂一样习惯了，但是在二楼蹦跶还是没那个勇气，生命诚可贵。

若只因两层结构便称之为古色古香，也未免太看不起房主了。可以这么说，这些烟火气大多来自房主的精心装饰。大海的方知查文里有茶室，但更多的文化气息并不来源于茶室，而是中庭：坛中鱼可两许头、皆若空游无所依。墙角一枝梅，藤满庭半百。回望犬两头，体威但可撸。破壶百八十、尽是花满庭。

若要说这屋子里还有啥古色生香的玩意，便是那三三两两、年龄比我还大的花雕、太师椅。当然还有一些不方便在网络上说的泡水烟花。山中岁月 与 且慢（原“七月”）也别具一番风味，岁月需要打磨，主人从早忙到晚，后面山中岁月不仅有兴坪第一蛋糕店，万一后面真能住在山中岁月呢。期待还是要有的。

七月的故事暂且不表，张哥应该会讲的吧。
